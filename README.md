# 🚀 TypeScript Crash Course

Welcome to the **TypeScript Crash Course** repository! 🎉 This repository follows the [YouTube Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gNhFQgS4edYLqP7LkZcFMN) by **The Net Ninja** and is packed with examples, notes, and projects to help you learn TypeScript! 📝

## 📚 Course Overview

In this crash course, we will explore TypeScript, a **typed superset** of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. TypeScript helps you write safer, more maintainable code with the power of static typing. 🛡️

This repository contains various sections, each covering important topics in TypeScript:

1. **Type Basics** 🧠
2. **Type Aliases & Union Types** 🔗
3. **Arrays & Object Literals** 📦
4. **Functions** 🔄
5. **Type Guards** 🛡️
6. **Tuples** 👫
7. **Interfaces** 📝
8. **Better Workflow with `tsconfig`** ⚙️

## 🔧 Installation & Setup
